when your wifi is not being found or it disconnects immediately, make sure your fixwifi script is executable using

```chmod +x fixwifi```

then run
```./fixwifi```
if you want to have this BASH script to run in the background, make sure to set up a crontab. explanations for how to setup the crontab is in the link below.
